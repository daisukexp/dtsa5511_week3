# Histopathologic Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks
For the assignment of week 3, we have a mini-project where we will participate in the Kaggle competition: Histopathologic Cancer Detection. This competition presents a binary image classification problem, where our objective is to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans.
The dataset is comprised of 220,025 TIFF images, each with dimensions of 96x96x3. These images are labeled with binary values: '1' indicates the presence of cancer, while '0' denotes its absence. Additionally, there are 57,458 unlabeled test images.
We will develop CNN models to classify the test images, and the performance of these models will be assessed based on their accuracy scores when submitted to the competition.
